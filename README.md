# VPC-Transit-Gateway


## Objective


The VPC Transit Gateway project focused on implementing and analyzing multi-region cloud networking architecture in AWS. The primary objective was to establish centralized connectivity between distributed VPCs while leveraging flow logs to monitor inter-VPC communication patterns. This hands-on implementation was designed to enhance understanding of cloud network design, traffic routing optimization, and scalable infrastructure management.


### Skills Learned


- Advanced understanding of AWS networking architecture and Transit Gateway concepts.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting VPC flow logs and traffic patterns.
- Ability to design and implement multi-region cloud connectivity solutions.
- Enhanced knowledge of VPC peering and centralized routing strategies.


### Tools Used


- AWS Transit Gateway for centralized VPC connectivity management.
- AWS CloudWatch Logs for capturing and storing VPC flow logs.
- CloudWatch Insights for analyzing and visualizing network traffic patterns.
