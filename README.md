# VPC-Transit-Gateway


## Objective


The VPC Transit Gateway project focused on implementing and analyzing multi-region cloud networking architecture in AWS. The primary objective was to establish centralized connectivity between distributed VPCs while leveraging flow logs to monitor inter-VPC communication patterns. This hands-on implementation was designed to enhance understanding of cloud network design, traffic routing optimization, and scalable infrastructure management.
### Skills Learned


- Advanced understanding of AWS networking architecture and Transit Gateway concepts.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting VPC flow logs and traffic patterns.
- Ability to design and implement multi-region cloud connectivity solutions.
- Enhanced knowledge of VPC peering and centralized routing strategies.


### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
